<h3>The Wind Rises</h3>
<p>This is my favourite Studio Ghibli Movie. I would say it is my biggest motivational show.</p>
<h3>Passion of the Christ</h3>
<p>As a Christian I have to say this has to be one of the best movie explanations of the life of Jesus Christ.</p>
<h3>Spider-Verse</h3>
<p>I have always been a fan of Spider and that wwill never end. This movie series encompasses all desires I may have in regards to anything animation related.</p>
